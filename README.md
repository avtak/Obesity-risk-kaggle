# Obesity-risk-kaggle
Obesity Prediction using ML Models: This project predicts obesity using Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and cross-validation. Gradient Boosting showed the best performance. Dataset from Kaggle.
Obesity Prediction using Machine Learning Models
This project aims to predict obesity using various machine learning models, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains multiple features related to dietary habits, physical activity, and other factors influencing obesity.

Key Features of the Project:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and duplicates
Encoding categorical variables
Data standardization
Outlier detection and removal
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Correlation matrix to understand feature relationships
Boxplots for outlier detection
Distribution analysis of target variable (obesity)
Machine Learning Models Implemented:

Random Forest
XGBoost
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score metrics
ROC Curves and AUC Scores
Cross-Validation Scores
Key Findings:

The Gradient Boosting model emerged as the best performer for predicting the risk of obesity, achieving the highest accuracy and AUC score.
Random Forest and XGBoost also showed strong performance.
Decision Tree had comparatively lower performance but still provided valuable insights.
This repository includes the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
